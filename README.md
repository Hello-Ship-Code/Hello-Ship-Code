# Hey there! 👋

I don't clutter my profile with a buffet of badges or a coding language checklist. Instead, I roll up my sleeves and build awesome stuff while breaking things along the way. 💥😎

## 🚀 What I Do
- Tinker with the **MERN Stack** (and yes, I still forget MongoDB queries sometimes)
- Wrestling with **TypeScript** like it's my arch-nemesis 🥋
- Styling my way through chaos with **Tailwind CSS** 🎨
- Currently attempting to speak **Go** fluently... still sounds like gibberish 🐹
- Dreaming up wild ideas and turning them into scalable web apps (sometimes they actually work!)

Let's code, break things, fix them, and repeat! 🔄🔥
